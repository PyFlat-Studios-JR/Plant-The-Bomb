- +Bomb: If you have collected *+Bomb*, you can place several bombs at once
- +Fire: Your explosion range has been increased by one
- Dynamite: You now have one dynamite you can place, but these explode in a range of 5*5, so run
- Time Bomb: You now have a time bomb, when you place it you can explode it as explained in the keybinds
- Smoke Grenade: Useless (will be removed in version 2.0)
- Ghost: When you collect a ghost, you get one of several curses, but you have to figure out for yourself what they do
- Water: You can't step on or walk over water, but the explosions will reach the other side if your range is long enough.
